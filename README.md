# FLIP IT 

RESPONSIVE IMAGERY HERE 

# Opening message: 
**FLIP IT** FLIP IT, is a memory based (timed) card game/puzzle. The aim of the game: Once the first card is flipped the timer starts and you have 60 seconds to flip over the cards and try and find the matching imagery. If you do not find a matching pair the cards are flipped back over and this gives you a chance to remember where the cards are for future selection within the game. When the time is up a modal pops up to let the user know the time is up and how many cards they flipped. If the user matches all cards within the time frame then a Congratulations modal pops up, telling the user 

This game is for users who enjoy a challenge, playing games and those who love a good memory game!

# Wireframes

Below is a rough sketch I made to plan each page. 



# Design
**colour scheme**
The colour scheme includes turquoise and yellow as these are vibrant colours that stand out.

# Typography 
Knewave is used with a back up of Sans Serif (the reason for the backup: if for any reason the font isnâ€™t being imported correctly to the site). The reason this font was chosen is because it has a playful feel to it which suits as it is a game site. 

# Imagery 
The images on the back of the cards is of a turquoise card with a yellow heart (following the colour scheme). The images of the animals are fun and vibrant. 

<img width="215" alt="Screenshot 2021-08-21 at 01 14 20" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84447603/130304197-bae6cbfd-6bb5-4738-8d07-2f13e8840267.png">. 

# FEATURES

### Landing page

1. The logo and welcome paragrpah
* For the user: Allows the user to know what the game is and what the game is called.
* For the company: Spreads the name of "FLIP-IT".

2. Time (60 seconds)
* For the user: tells the user how much time they will have to play.

3. The card game itself
* For the user: allows the user to play the game, activates the timer to begin when card is flipped, activates a modal to appear if user has won or not and how many cards are flipped (so the user can keep track).

4. Game Rules
* Once clicked brings user to an overlay, the reason I choose an overlay was to make it easier for the user to read the rules in a simply setting.
* For the user: easy to read and understand, can click anywhere and will be brought straight back to the game.

5. Reset Cards
* For the user: Shuffles the deck to allow a new variation each time, making the game fun and varied.

Git was used for version control by utilizing the Gitpod terminal to commit to Git and Push to GitHub.
(quoted from samplereadme https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/SampleREADME)
* GitHub:
* GitHub is used to store the projects code after being pushed from Git. (quoted from samplereadme https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/SampleREADME)

# Known Bugs
* Within some of the responsive imagery when the Game Rules are clicked it appears to move the heading out of view.
* Within some of the responsive imagery even with the change to the styling the buttons still appear more on the left side of the screen than intended in some of the models. 

# Future ideas to implement on site
* Upon entry to the site offer a selection of themes for the user to choose from, once the themes are chosen, the images will be different depending on the theme chosen.
