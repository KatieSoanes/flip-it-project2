# FLIP IT 

RESPONSIVE IMAGERY HERE 

# Opening message: 
**FLIP IT** FLIP IT, is a memory based (timed) card game/puzzle. The aim of the game: Once the first card is flipped the timer starts and you have 60 seconds to flip over the cards and try and find the matching imagery. If you do not find a matching pair the cards are flipped back over and this gives you a chance to remember where the cards are for future selection within the game. When the time is up a modal pops up to let the user know the time is up and how many cards they flipped. If the user matches all cards within the time frame then a Congratulations modal pops up, telling the user 

This game is for users who enjoy a challenge, playing games and those who love a good memory game!

# Wireframes

Below is a rough sketch I made to plan each page. 

![home page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84447603/125380025-7b160f00-e389-11eb-952d-ac32565a00d8.jpeg)

![event and signup form](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84447603/125380020-79e4e200-e389-11eb-9606-297003991953.jpeg)

![gallery and our ethos](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84447603/125380014-781b1e80-e389-11eb-8f73-29d13fc73ef7.jpeg) 

# Design
**colour scheme**
<img width="1431" alt="Screenshot 2021-07-11 at 21 18 25" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84447603/125208947-8e43b480-e28d-11eb-9db0-ebfa60d9ff7f.png">
The three main colours used are blue, white and a red-orange shade. I felt these colours really compliment one another and the colours together have a very alluring effect. Blue is a naturally calming colour and it is soothing so it makes the user feel relaxed upon arrivial to the site. 

# Typography 
Open Sans is used with a back up of Sans Serif (the reason for the backup: if for any reason the font isn’t being imported correctly to the site). The reason this font was chosen is because it is very easily legible and aesthetically pleasing. 

<img width="612" alt="Screenshot 2021-07-13 at 03 59 50" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84447603/125383096-cb43a000-e38e-11eb-9a0c-706b1fb94d67.png">

# Imagery 
Throughout the website there are an array of images all based around fashion for example catwalk fashion images, images of clothing rails and images of people who attended "past events".
The reason I went for the imagery used is to capture the visitors attention. On **our ethos** page, each picture reflects the topic being discussed for example cost with an image of a money bank to reflect savings. Images are easier to process than reading words of text so I feel the images really enhance the website and add a fashionable aspect. As John Medina said
>Hear a piece of information, and three days later you’ll remember 10% of it. Add a picture, and you’ll remember 65%

# Known Bugs
* When I send the link to my mobile device there is a gap on the right hand side of the screen on the home page with spacing and as a result not all the text lines up correctly.
* On my mobile device the gallery page the end images are slightly cut off.
* On my mobile device the sign up form is not centered with gapping on the right hand side.
* I am unsure why this has happened as upon inspection it fits perfectly on an iphone se and my Lighthouse score is very high.

# Future ideas to implement on site
* Add a fun fashion quiz to get people more involved and interact online.
* Add another page where images of popular clothing items are included for example high waisted jeans, this would show what items are very popular and aid people to actually make a swap on the day.
